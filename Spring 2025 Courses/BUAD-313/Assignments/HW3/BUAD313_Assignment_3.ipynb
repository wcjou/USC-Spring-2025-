        " - You may work in teams of up to 3.  Submit one assignment for the three of you, but please ensure it has all 3 of your names and @usc.edu emails.\n",
        " - You must submit your work as a .ipynb file (jupyter notebook). The grader has to be able to run your notebook. Code that doesn't run gets zero points.  A Great way to check that your code runs is to Select \"Clear All Outputs\", \"Restart\" and then \"Run All\" and make sure it still shows all your answer properly!\n",
        " - Use the existing sections below to submit your answers below.  You can add additional Python/markdown cells to describe and explain your solution, but keep it tidy.  Consider formatting some of your markdown cells for the grader.  [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)\n",
        " - For some of the modeling quesitons, you may prefer to write your solution with paper and pencil and then include a photo in the markdown.  That's OK! Just please remember to include the file for your photo in your submission so that it renders proeprly.\n",
