        "\n",
        "One of the unforeseen challenges in scaling up computing has been the massive envergy requirements of server farms and compute clusters.  A big portion of these requirements come from the need to cool the room (so the servers don't overheat).  But as they're working, the compute servers generate heat themselves.  We'll look at a stylized model to think about how to minimize cooling costs for a server farm.  We will focus for simplicity on an 8 hour day (although real farms run around the clock!).  In what follows, you should think like a physicist and interpret \"cooling\" as \"negative heat.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "In the absence of any other effects, we would expect that the temperature at the beginning of an hour would be the same as the temperature at the beginning of the previous hour.  We will say that to operate effecively, the server room must remain at or below 25 degrees Celsius at all times.  Notice the day starts at 9 am with a temperature of $22$ degrees Celsius.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, there are a few effects we should model:\n",
        "  - During the  hour, the compute servers will do work.  As they work they generate additional heat.\n",
        "  - During the hour, the ambient temperature provide additional heat (if it's hotter outside) or reduce the heat (if it's colder outside).  \n",
        "  - During the hour, any cooling we apply (e.g. by cranking up the AC) will reduce the heat in the room.\n",
        "\n",
        "In theory, we should model the precise temperature in the server room at all points in time (i.e. continuously).  As an approximation, we're only going to think about the temperature in the room at the beginning of every hour (starting at 9 am, and including 4:00 pm) and also at the end of the day (5:00 pm).  We're also going to assume that any additional heat generated or removed *during* the hour doesn't affect the temperature now, but affects the temperature in the next hour.\n",
