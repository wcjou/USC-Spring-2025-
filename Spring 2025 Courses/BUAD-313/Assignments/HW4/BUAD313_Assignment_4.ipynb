        " - You may work in teams of up to 3.  Submit one assignment for the three of you, but please ensure it has all 3 of your names and @usc.edu emails.\n",
        " - You must submit your work as a .ipynb file (jupyter notebook). The grader has to be able to run your notebook. Code that doesn't run gets zero points.  A Great way to check that your code runs is to Select \"Clear All Outputs\", \"Restart\" and then \"Run All\" and make sure it still shows all your answer properly!\n",
        " - Use the existing sections below to submit your answers below.  You can add additional Python/markdown cells to describe and explain your solution, but keep it tidy.  Consider formatting some of your markdown cells for the grader.  [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)\n",
        " - For some of hte modeling quesitons, you may prefer to write your solution with paper and pencil and then include a photo in the markdown.  That's OK! Just please remember to include the file for your photo in your submission so that it renders proeprly.\n",

        "SwiftShip is a fast-growing e-commerce company that delivers products throughout the United States. As the company plans for the upcoming year, it must decide which of **five potential fulfillment centers** to rent and use for shipping products to its customers. Renting a fulfillment center comes with a **fixed annual cost**, which includes facility operations, staffing, and infrastructure.\n",

These forecasts represent the total number of units expected to be shipped to each zone in the upcoming year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each fulfillment center has a **maximum shipping capacity** — the total number of units it can process and send out over the year. Products can be shipped from any active fulfillment center to any customer zone. However, **shipping costs vary** depending on the distance between the fulfillment center and the customer zone.\n",
        "\n",
