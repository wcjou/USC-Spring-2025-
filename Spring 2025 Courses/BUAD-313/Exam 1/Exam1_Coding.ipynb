    "# Bike Redistribution (35 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Los Angeles operates a bike-sharing program with **10 stations** spread across different neighborhoods. Throughout the day, commuters rent bikes from one station and return them to another, creating **imbalances in bike availability** across the network. Each station can hold at most **285 bikes** at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban planners typically think about bike demand as occurring in **four periods** throughout the day, corresponding to **morning rush hour, afternoon, evening rush hour, and after hours**. The times for each period are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8 AM - 12 PM** (Morning Rush Hour)\n",
    "- **12 PM - 4 PM** (Afternoon)\n",
    "- **4 PM - 8 PM** (Evening Rush Hour)\n",
    "- **8 PM - 8 AM** (After Hours)\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume that **demand remains the same every day of the week**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redistribution Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that each station has enough bikes available at the **start of each period**, the city employs a **redistribution team** that uses trucks to pick up and move bikes between stations **just before the next period begins**. We assume that bikes are **moved instantaneously** before each shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redistribution Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of redistribution depends on multiple factorsâ€”such as the number of trucks, travel distances, and truck capacity. To keep things simple, we assume that **redistribution costs are proportional to the total distance traveled** by the redistributed bikes throughout the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The distance that bikes travel when rented by riders **does not contribute** to redistribution costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the redistribution team is to **minimize costs** while ensuring that each station has enough bikes at the **start of each period** to meet its demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and the \"Pre\" Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a **\"pre\" notebook** that loads the following data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The demand matrix**, specifying the number of bike trips between each pair of stations in each time period.\n",
    "- **The distance matrix**, providing the distance (in miles) between each pair of stations."
